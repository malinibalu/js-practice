/*
 dataypes - 2 types
1.Primitive datatype
    String
    Number
    Boolean 
    BigInt - work with integers that exceed the maximum safe integer value (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER), which is 2^53 - 1.
            BigInt is powerful while handling large integers, it may not perform as regular integers due to the 
            additional complexity  
    Undefined
    Null
    Symbols - Used in OOPs

2. Non-primitive datatype
    Object- set of data used to organise and store values.
            Eg: var person ={
            Name = Malini
            ID : 42
            }    
            console.log(person);
    Array - object type data
        Initialisation of variable  - var x;
        Declaration of variable -  x=5;
        Assignments - Combining initialisation and declaration  -   var x=5;
