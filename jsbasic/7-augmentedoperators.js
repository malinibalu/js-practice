// compound assignment with augmented addition 
//these are operators will do both nodemathematical operation and assignment in one step.

//addition

var a=4;

console.log(a);
//same with augmented operator  +=
var a=3;
console.log(a+=2);


//subtraction

var a=5;
console.log(a=a-2);
//same with -=
var a=7;
console.log(a-=2);

//multiplication

var a=4;

//division
var a=3;
b=a/2;
c=6;
console.log(b);
